Thought this was easier than typing it out on Moodle.
1. Pygame uses classes to create things in a digital environment. This way, we can have things with behaviors or methods that we can use while the program is running.
Think of an enemy in a video game: there would be a class for it, and a method if it got hit by an attack.

2. Yes, but it would be a lot harder. If it were me doing it, a specific action would change a list element, and if that element were a specific value, then it would 
execute one specific piece of code. With classes and methods, it can have behaviors that do things automatically instead of some roundabout way.
